# Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Report

## Client and Software Requirements:
- Artemis Financial was the client, and they required a software solution to generate and validate checksums for financial data.

- The issue addressed was the need for a secure method to generate checksums for financial transactions to ensure data integrity and security.

## Coding Securely and Importance of Software Security:

- One of the key strengths was the thorough identification and mitigation of security vulnerabilities in the client's software.

- Coding securely is crucial because it helps prevent data breaches, unauthorized access, and other cyber threats. It ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data, which are critical for maintaining trust with customers and stakeholders.

- Software security adds value to a company's overall wellbeing by safeguarding sensitive information, protecting against financial losses and reputational damage, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Challenges and Helpful Aspects of Vulnerability Assessment:

- The challenge was in identifying and addressing vulnerabilities across different layers of the software application.

- The assessment was helpful in identifying potential security risks and guiding the implementation of appropriate mitigation strategies.

## Increasing Layers of Security and Future Assessment:

- Layers of security were increased by implementing secure coding practices, validating user input, using secure communication protocols, and properly handling errors.

- In the future, vulnerability assessments can be conducted using automated tools, manual code reviews, and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities and prioritize mitigation techniques.

## Functional and Secure Code:

- Code functionality and security were ensured through rigorous testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and security testing.

- After refactoring the code, additional testing was conducted to identify any newly introduced vulnerabilities.

## Resources, Tools, and Practices:

- Tools such as static code analyzers, dependency checkers, and security frameworks were used to enhance security.

- Best practices such as input validation, secure coding guidelines, and regular security updates were followed.

## Examples for Future Employers:

- This project showcases my ability to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities, implement secure coding practices, and ensure the functionality and security of software applications.

- This assignment demonstrates skills software security, risk assessment, and secure coding, which are valuable assets for any employer in the technology industry.
